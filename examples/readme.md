In this 2 examples, you can understand how to can change (patch) instructions of jar file.
In example 1 I show how you can find instructions window.
In example 2 I show how you can patch string in a jar file. 

I hope, after 2 examples, you can easily understand how can patch jar files (not only strings but other instructions too).
